# Termux (Android) dependencies
# pvrecorder and PyAudio are NOT needed — sox handles microphone access.
# pvporcupine is included: the bot patches the CPU detection for mobile ARM
# cores at runtime. If the native library can't load on Android, it falls
# back to sox + Google Speech Recognition for wake word detection.
